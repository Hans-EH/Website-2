            Danish person currently residing in the
            capital region of Denmark. My passion is anything data related:
            Visualizing, extrapolating, and securing data. 
            Iâ€™m currently doing a BSc in Software engineering. My
            primary technological competencies lie in the following areas: Software architecture, cyber security, software development using principles of OOP
            (Java, C#, and Python), full stack development (MERN stack, SQL),
            digital electronics (C), quantum computing (Qiskit) and general data science. All of which I
            have applied either through work or in large solo- or group projects consisting of 6-7
            people.{" "}
